Collection of custom integrated circuits made by a manufacturer of game console and computer known as 'Atari' in the
period from 1970 to 2000.

This collection is limited to integrated circuits designed for a family of computers know as 'ST'. '16-32' refers to
the fact that the main data bus was 16 bits wide, while the size of the CPU registers was 32 bits wide.
